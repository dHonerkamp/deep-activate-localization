------------
1. fix the rgb - nan/inf issue for non-parallel env
2. then try on-policy algorithm say PPO for navigation task (task_obs and rgb_obs)
3. then try to incorporate pfnet into rl agent

May 12th 2021
-------------
1. fix ppo with rgb_obs
2. test pretrained pfnet
3. check if end to end works or need any changes


end project goals:
1. reproduce pfnet on housing dataset
2. fine tuned it to igibson
3. use pretrained pfnet with rl agent ppo -> with better representation of particles
4. end-to-end pfnet + rl agent
5. baseline comparision
